            <p class="hideMe">If you're looking for a good PC game to play, you've come to the right place. There are a lot of video games in this round up that'll entertain you, and they're neatly organized by genre. Steam users (and if you're a PC gamer, how aren't you one?) should visit PCMag's Steam Curator page and Steam Discussion Group, too. Our reviews live there, as well as several themed lists featuring highly regarded titles.</p>
            <p class="hideMe">
                This category combines action games, role-playing games, and real-time strategy games. In this subgenre of strategy games, players usually don't build resources such as bases or combat units. Instead, players control a single character in one of two teams, working together to try and destroy the other teamâ€™s base (they are often aided in the task by the help of computer-controlled units that attack on a set path).
                Imagine a game soup flavored with chunky bits of old school 2D Castlevania, Portal, and BioShock, and you still wouldn't get close to describing The Swapper. The game's not quite a platformer; it's a puzzle game, packaged with a brooding sci-fi story set in space. Finnish company Facepalm Games delivers a fascinating, memorable exploration title that can sustain at least two plays through because of multiple endings.
